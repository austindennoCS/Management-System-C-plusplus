<h1>Programming Project Documentation</h1>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<b>This documentation details a C++ project that demonstrates object-oriented programming through the management of student records, showcasing data handling, validation, and operations within a structured application environment.</b>

<h2 id="student-class">Student Class (`student.h` and `student.cpp`)</h2>
<b>Purpose:</b> Manages individual student information.
<ul>
  <li>Stores details like student ID, names, email, age, days to complete courses, and degree program.</li>
  <li>Provides constructors for initializing student objects either with default or specified values.</li>
  <li>Includes accessors and mutators for safe data handling.</li>
  <li>Implements methods to display detailed student information, enhancing data presentation in console outputs.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="roster-class">Roster Class (`roster.h` and `roster.cpp`)</h2>
<b>Purpose:</b> Manages a collection of `Student` objects as a roster.
<ul>
  <li>Manages an array of `Student` pointers, handling dynamic student record creation and deletion.</li>
  <li>Includes methods to add, remove, and display student data.</li>
  <li>Implements search and filter capabilities, such as displaying students by degree program or finding students with invalid email formats.</li>
  <li>Ensures comprehensive memory management to avoid leaks.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="degree-enumeration">Degree Enumeration (`degree.h`)</h2>
<b>Purpose:</b> Defines an enumeration for degree programs (SECURITY, NETWORK, SOFTWARE) to categorize students.
<ul>
  <li>Facilitates the categorization of students by their academic program.</li>
  <li>Used across the `Student` and `Roster` classes to maintain consistent handling of degree programs.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="main-program">Main Program (`main.cpp`)</h2>
<b>Purpose:</b> Serves as the entry point for the program, orchestrating the flow of data and interactions between classes.
<ul>
  <li>Parses student data formatted in a structured way to initialize the `Roster` with `Student` objects.</li>
  <li>Calls functions to demonstrate the capabilities of the `Roster`, such as adding, removing, and displaying student data.</li>
  <li>Showcases error handling and data validation, like filtering out invalid emails and calculating average days in courses.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="project-objectives">Project Objectives</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming:</b> Utilize classes, objects, and enums to encapsulate data and functions, promoting modular, scalable, and maintainable code architecture.</li>
  <li><b>Manage Student Data:</b> Provide a system that handles student information dynamically, supporting basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).</li>
  <li><b>Implement Data Validation and Processing:</b> Ensure data integrity through robust validation techniques and provide useful summaries and analytics, such as average days to course completion.</li>
  <li><b>Showcase Practical C++ Usage:</b> Apply C++ programming concepts in a realistic scenario, emphasizing the use of pointers, dynamic memory management, and file structure organization.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<b>This documentation provides a comprehensive view of a C++ programming project that leverages object-oriented principles to create a robust application for student record management. The detailed overview of each class and program functionality illustrates the practical application of programming concepts and their importance in developing scalable and effective software solutions.</b>
